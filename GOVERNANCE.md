# Governance

The organization currently consists only of [@drewmcarthur](//github.com/drewmcarthur), 
and follows the structure of a [benevolent dictator](https://communityrule.info/templates/benevolent-dictator.html).  
This is not meant to be its permanent structure, 
and the organization will [progressively decentralize](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/progressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework/) over time.

This will take the form of an Open Collective organization for 
infrastructure costs (however minimal) and holding 
digital property like the [pmsky.social](//pmsky.social) domain name.

Other aspects could include deliberation platforms such as [loomio.com](//loomio.com) 
or feature prioritization like [canny.io](//canny.io).  Until such features are necessary, 
these will remain solely a possibility for future direction.

Requests for progress in this domain can be opened as an [issue](https://github.com/pmsky-social/meta/issues/new) in this repository!
